# Askify

> Askify is a question queue platform targeted at the classroom. Students can "add themselves to the queue" to receive help by describing their challenge/ question/ issue. Teachers and other students can see what others are struggling with and provide assistance.

> Additionally, students can only have ONE question in the queue. To ask for help on a new topic, they will first have to "answer" their question. Students questions and answer pairs are visible in the archive tab allowing other students to potentially research and answer their own question/ challenge/ issue.

* Let students enter digital queue for teacher
* Other students can view queue and offer help reducing the reliance on teach assistance
* Students can view recent question - answer pairs to see if someone has solved their issue recently
* Teachers can load balance based on queue length (potentially ask for help )
